# PyPPM
## An open source Earth's Field NMR Spectrometer

### Introduction

The PyPPM project includes a set of hardware and software designs that enable
anyone to perform [Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance) experiments using
the Earth's magnetic field.

There are two principal hardware designs in the PyPPM project. The first,
PyPPMv1, is a Proton Precession Magnetometer
